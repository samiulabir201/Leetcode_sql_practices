-- CREATE TABLE my_new_database.followers (
--     user_id int ,
--     follower_id int,
--     PRIMARY KEY (user_id, follower_id)
-- );

-- INSERT INTO my_new_database.followers(user_id, follower_id)
-- VALUESs
--     (0,1),
--     (1,0),
--     (2,0),
--     (2,1);

-- Overview
-- We want to find the followers for each user in this problem.

-- (user_id, follower_id) is the primary key for this table.

-- This implies that there will be unique combinations of user_id and follower_id in the table. For example, you cannot have the following table:

-- +---------+-------------+
-- | user_id | follower_id |
-- +---------+-------------+
-- |    1    |      2      |
-- |    1    |      2      |
-- +---------+-------------+
-- The same combination of user_id and follower_id cannot occur multiple times.

-- In the table below, user 1 has three followers.

-- +---------+-------------+
-- | user_id | follower_id |
-- +---------+-------------+
-- |    1    |      2      |
-- |    1    |      3      |
-- |    1    |      4      |
-- |    3    |      2      |
-- |    3    |      5      |
-- +---------+-------------+
-- Next, we need to ensure that our output users are ordered by user_id in ascending order.

-- For the example shared above the output should look like:

-- +---------+-----------------+
-- | user_id | followers_count |
-- +---------+-----------------+
-- |    1    |        3        |
-- |    3    |        2        |
-- +---------+-----------------+
-- Approach: COUNT and GROUP BY
-- Intuition
-- We essentially need to count the number of times a particular user_id occurs in the user_id column and this count will be equal to the follower count. This is because each (user_id, follower_id) combination is unique. We can try to use the COUNT function to count the occurences of a single user_id. Remember, COUNT is an aggregate function, you will have to tell it which field to aggregate by. This can be done using the GROUP BY clause. Since we want to print the user_id and its count in the table, we can do GROUP BY user_id.

-- Lastly, we can use the ORDER BY clause to order the result by user_id.

-- Algorithm
-- SELECT user_id, COUNT(user_id) AS followers_count: This part specifies the columns to be selected in the result set. Here, we want to retrieve the user_id and the count of followers for each user. The COUNT(user_id) function is used to count the number of rows in the followers table, which represents the number of followers for a particular user. The result of this count is aliased as followers_count to match the output requirements of the problem.

-- FROM followers: This part specifies the table from which the data is being retrieved.

-- GROUP BY user_id: This part groups the rows based on the user_id column. By using GROUP BY, the query will calculate the count of followers for each unique user_id. The result set will have one row for each unique user_id.

-- ORDER BY user_id ASC: This part orders the result set based on the user_id column in ascending order. ASC stands for ascending. Please note, the default ordering done by the ORDER BY clause is ascending. So removing ASC from the query will also work.

-- Implementation
-- SQL
SELECT user_id, COUNT(user_id) AS followers_count
FROM my_new_database.followers
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY user_id ASC;
