-- pandas
-- To identify customers who visited but did not make any transactions, we need to remove the records of customers who made transactions from the list of all customers who visited. By doing so, we convert this problem to a typical "NOT IN" problem. There are two main ways to solve "NOT IN" problems: 1) using the function similar to NOT IN/EXISTS directly or 2)LEFT OUTER JOIN/merge where the right table is set as NULL. We will introduce both methods in pandas and Mysql.

-- Approach 1: Removing Records Using ~ and isin()
-- Algorithm
-- For this approach, we leverage the functions ~ and isin() to exclude unwanted records from the list. Since we want to remove the customers who made transactions from all customers who visited, we first identify those customers from the DataFrame visits to see who are also in the DataFrame transactions using isin(). We then remove these visits from all visits using ~.

-- visits_no_trans = visits[~visits.visit_id.isin(transactions.visit_id)]

-- This step creates a new DataFrame that contains the visits that the customers made no transactions.

-- visit_id	customer_id
-- 4	30
-- 6	96
-- 7	54
-- 8	54
-- The next step is to count how many of these types of visits were made by each customer. To do this, we have the results grouped by the customer_id and count the visit_id. To get the final output, we also need to rename the column that stores the calculated result.

-- df = visits_no_trans.groupby('customer_id', as_index=False)['visit_id'].count()

-- return df.rename(columns={'visit_id': 'count_no_trans'})

-- Python implementation

-- import pandas as pd

-- def find_customers(visits: pd.DataFrame, transactions: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

--    visits_no_trans = visits[~visits.visit_id.isin(transactions.visit_id)]
   
--    df = visits_no_trans.groupby('customer_id', as_index=False)['visit_id'].count()
    
--    return df.rename(columns={'visit_id': 'count_no_trans'})

-- Approach 2: Removing Records Using left merge and isna()
-- Algorithm
-- For this approach, we leverage the left merge and isna() to achieve the same goal: removing the visits with transactions from all visits. To do this, we first left merge the DataFrame visits that contain all visit_ids to the DataFrame transactions that contain only the visit_ids that have transactions. We want to make sure the records that need to be removed are placed in the right DataFrame.

-- visits_no_trans = visits.merge(transactions, on='visit_id', how='left')

-- We now have a DataFrame with all visit_ids and their corresponding transactions. The visits that have no transactions associated return null values for the column transaction_id.

-- visit_id	customer_id	transaction_id	amount
-- 1	23	12	910
-- 2	9	13	970
-- 4	30	null	null
-- 5	54	2	310
-- 5	54	3	300
-- 5	54	9	200
-- 6	96	null	null
-- 7	54	null	null
-- 8	54	null	null
-- Now we only need to remove those visits that have null transactions. We can use the function isna() to achieve this.

-- visits_no_trans = visits_no_trans[visits_no_trans.transaction_id.isna()]

-- The DataFrame visits_no_trans now retains only the visits that have no transactions.

-- visit_id	customer_id	transaction_id	amount
-- 4	30	null	null
-- 6	96	null	null
-- 7	54	null	null
-- 8	54	null	null
-- Next, we want to count how many of these types of visits were made by each customer. To do this, we have the results grouped by the customer_id and count the visit_id. To get the final output, we also need to rename the column that stores the calculated result.

-- df = visits_no_trans.groupby('customer_id', as_index=False)['visit_id'].count()

-- return df.rename(columns={'visit_id': 'count_no_trans'})

-- Python implementation 2
-- import pandas as pd

-- def find_customers(visits: pd.DataFrame, transactions: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

--    visits_no_trans = visits.merge(transactions, on='visit_id', how='left')

--    visits_no_trans = visits_no_trans[visits_no_trans.transaction_id.isna()]

--    df = visits_no_trans.groupby('customer_id', as_index=False)['visit_id'].count()

--    return df.rename(columns={'visit_id': 'count_no_trans'})

-- database
-- Approach 1: Removing Records Using NOT IN/EXISTS
-- Algorithm
-- For this approach, we remove the visits that have transactions directly using NOT IN. Let's start by identifying these visits. For this problem, they are all the visit_id from the table Transactions.

-- SELECT visit_id FROM Transactions
-- Next, in the main query, we can COUNT the visit_id at the customer_id level from table Visits excluding the visits we identified in the subquery. The aggregate value is grouped at the customer_id level as we are looking for the total result for each customer. This column is also renamed as requested by the final output.

-- Implementation
-- SELECT 
--   customer_id, 
--   COUNT(visit_id) AS count_no_trans 
-- FROM 
--   Visits 
-- WHERE 
--   visit_id NOT IN (
--     SELECT 
--       visit_id 
--     FROM 
--       Transactions
--   ) 
-- GROUP BY 
--   customer_id
-- â€‹

-- Approach 2: Removing Records Using LEFT JOIN and IS NULL
-- Algorithm
-- For this approach, we want to exclude visits that involved transactions from the complete set of visits by using LEFT JOIN. To do this, we have all visits as the left table (table Visits) to join the visits from table Transactions on the shared column visit_id. To remove the records from the right table, we set its key as NULL, so the remains in the Visits table are the records of visits where no transactions occurred.

-- To get the final output, we want to COUNT the number of such visits associated with each customer_id, and have the aggregated value grouped at the customer_id level. Lastly, we update the column as requested in the original problem statement.

-- Implementation
-- SELECT 
--   customer_id, 
--   COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans 
-- FROM 
--   Visits AS v 
--   LEFT JOIN Transactions AS t ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id 
-- WHERE 
--   t.visit_id IS NULL 
-- GROUP BY 
--   customer_id
