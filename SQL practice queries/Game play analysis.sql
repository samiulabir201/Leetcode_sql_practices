-- Approach 1: Grouping and Extracting the Minimum
-- Algorithm
-- Group rows into subgroups specific to each player by means of GROUP BY player_id.
-- Retrieve the earliest event_date for each subgroup by means of MIN().
-- Return the result set in any order (ORDER BY is not necessary here).
-- We can use groupby() function to group the data in activity by the player_id column, it allows us to perform operations on subsets of the data based on the unique player ID. This step ensures that we can analyze the data on a per-player basis. Once the data is grouped by player_id, we select the event_date column using and apply the function min() to this column, by doing so, we find the minimum (earliest) date within each group of player_id. This will give us the first login date for each player.

-- df = activity.groupby('player_id')['event_date'].min().reset_index()

-- We will have the following DataFrame df, where each event_date is the first login in date of the corresponding player:

-- player_id	event_date
-- 1	2016-03-01
-- 2	2017-06-25
-- 3	2016-03-02

-- Note that the final output is a DataFrame with two columns: player_id and first_login. Hence, we need to rename the column event_date as first_login.

-- Implementation

-- import pandas as pd

-- def game_analysis(activity: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
--     df = activity.groupby('player_id')['event_date'].min().reset_index()

--     return df.rename(columns = {'event_date':'first_login'})

-- We will get the DataFrame as follows.

-- player_id	first_login
-- 1	2016-03-01
-- 2	2017-06-25
-- 3	2016-03-02

-- Overview
-- Problem reference: Report the first login date for
-- each player. Return the result table in any order.

-- The challenge in this problem is to figure out how to access and report an
-- extreme value (i.e., first login date) for each player. How could we group
-- all rows by player and report the "smallest" date (i.e., the earliest occurring
-- date) for each player?

-- Approach 1 below highlights what is probably the most natural solution, namely
-- using GROUP BY in conjunction with MIN(). Approach 2 highlights more
-- advanced alternative solutions that rely on using window functions.

-- Approach 1: Grouping and Extracting the Minimum
-- Algorithm
-- If this is your first time using GROUP BY with an aggregate like MIN(),
-- then it may first be beneficial to ponder what kind of aggregate information
-- you could pull from the following query:

-- SELECT
--   A.player_id
-- FROM
--   Activity A
-- GROUP BY
--   A.player_id;

-- The result set for this query may not be exciting at first:

-- +-----------+
-- | player_id |
-- +-----------+
-- |         1 |
-- |         2 |
-- |         3 |
-- +-----------+
-- But, using the example in the problem description, once rows have been grouped
-- by player_id, essentially we have the following information at our disposal
-- for each group (i.e., each player_id in this case):

-- 1:
-- device_id: 2, 2
-- event_date: 2016-03-01, 2016-05-02
-- games_played: 5, 6
-- 2:
-- device_id: 3
-- event_date: 2017-06-25
-- games_played: 1
-- 3:
-- device_id: 1, 4
-- event_date: 2016-03-02, 2018-07-03
-- games_played: 0, 5
-- The breakdown above makes it clear we have three groups in total (one for each
-- distinct player_id). For players with player_id values of 1, 2, and
-- 3, we have 2, 1, and 2 subgroups, respectively. Any aggregate function we use
-- will be applied to values in the subgroups for each group. Since we are
-- interested in the first login date for each player, we will use the MIN()
-- aggregate function to essentially scan every event_date subgroup value for
-- each group to find the smallest one. The smallest value for each group will be
-- the first_login value reported:

-- Implementation
-- SELECT
--   A.player_id,
--   MIN(A.event_date) AS first_login
-- FROM
--   Activity A
-- GROUP BY
--   A.player_id;
-- Approach 2: Window functions
-- Intuition
-- The following solutions make use of window functions and should be considered
-- medium-level solutions for an easy-level problem. It should be said that just
-- because you can use a window function does not mean you should use a window
-- function.

-- The FIRST_VALUE() window function can be used in crafting a
-- solution to this problem:

-- SELECT DISTINCT
--   A.player_id,
--   FIRST_VALUE(A.event_date) OVER (
--     PARTITION BY
--       A.player_id
--     ORDER BY
--       A.event_date
--   ) AS first_login
-- FROM
--   Activity A;
-- Note: Use of DISTINCT is necessary due to the nature of how window
-- functions work. If we did not use DISTINCT, then, using the example in the
-- problem description, we would end up with the following (incorrect) result set:

-- +-----------+-------------+
-- | player_id | first_login |
-- +-----------+-------------+
-- |         1 | 2016-03-01  |
-- |         1 | 2016-03-01  |
-- |         2 | 2017-06-25  |
-- |         3 | 2016-03-02  |
-- |         3 | 2016-03-02  |
-- +-----------+-------------+
-- For those who are curious, it is also possible to craft a solution to this
-- problem using the LAST_VALUE() window function, but care must be taken in
-- effectively defining the window function frame
-- specification.
-- If we did not provide a frame specification, then, using the example from the
-- problem description, we would get the following (incorrect) result set:

-- +-----------+-------------+
-- | player_id | first_login |
-- +-----------+-------------+
-- |         1 | 2016-05-02  |
-- |         1 | 2016-03-01  |
-- |         2 | 2017-06-25  |
-- |         3 | 2018-07-03  |
-- |         3 | 2016-03-02  |
-- +-----------+-------------+
-- As noted in the MySQL
-- docs,
-- using ORDER BY within a window function results in the following default
-- frame specification:

-- RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
-- If ORDER BY is not specified, then the default frame specification is as
-- follows:

-- RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
-- Hence, an appropriate frame specification when using LAST_VALUE() would look
-- something like the following:

-- SELECT DISTINCT
--   A.player_id,
--   LAST_VALUE(A.event_date) OVER (
--     PARTITION BY
--       A.player_id
--     ORDER BY
--       A.event_date DESC RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
--       AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
--   ) AS first_login
-- FROM
--   Activity A;
-- An inline view can be used in conjunction with RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), or
-- ROW_NUMBER(). The choice will not impact the outcome because (player_id, event_date) is the primary key of the Activity table (i.e., we do not have
-- to worry about the possibility of more than a single row having a rnk value
-- of 1 since partitions are created by player_id and rows are ordered by
-- event_date, thus guaranteeing unique rnk values).

-- Implementation
SELECT
  X.player_id,
  X.event_date AS first_login
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      A.player_id,
      A.event_date,
      RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY
          A.player_id
        ORDER BY
          A.event_date
      ) AS rnk
    FROM
      my_new_database.Activity A
  ) X
WHERE
  X.rnk = 1;

-- Conclusion
-- We recommend Approach 1 due to its simplicity and how it naturally suggests
-- itself as a solution to this problem.

-- Approach 2 is useful in that it highlights many alternative solutions that
-- would be good to remark on in an interview context. If you encountered this
-- problem in an interview, then Approach 1 should be sufficient. But utilizing
-- any solution from Approach 2 should still leave a favorable impression on the
-- interviewer by suggesting you can find a solution to the problem at hand in
-- multiple ways, however sophisticated that way may need to be.
